## OUR PURPOSE

Welcome to our Rocker center!

You probably know this, but I'm saying it again: Rock changes a lot. Fast! All the time! That's what growing things do.
They change. So, we feel that the content we create about ourselves should do the same.

That's why we built Rocker Center

Here almost every page is fully editable. And you, fellow Rocker, are already an accredited editor. Feel free to add information, correct mistakes, and make our knowledge base grow and evolve with us. Don't worry too much. Every page is fully editable, and all changes can be reviewed, questioned, undone, and re-done whenever needed. Just do your best!

Here are a few suggestions on pages I think you'd like to start on. If that's not your thing, that's cool! Just hit the search bar and take a look around. Didn't find what you needed? Why not start your own page? Just click here to get started.

   ## Who we are
   
Basic Overview:
Rock Content is a Saas (software as a service) organization.
Our clients are other business (B2B) 
We have multiple products (Ion Interactive, Visually, Live, Studio, iClips and Rock.OS), all aimed at helping our clients to create content experiences that attract, engage, and convert their audiences.

What is content, and why is it important?
Content is important because it gets our attention. We all interact with content regularly: we find interesting articles on Facebook or Twitter, we receive email newsletters, we watch how-to videos on YouTube, we read news articles, we attend online webinars. All of these are examples of content...produced ultimately for one purpose: to get your attention.

Why is your attention so important? Because your attention may eventually convert to $. And dollars keep businesses alive.

How does attention lead to $?  The more targeted visitors an organization can attract, the greater the likelihood that many of those visitors will become paying customers. For brands, this means that a product or service may be purchased. For media organizations, subscriptions may be purchased to supplement the ad revenue they get from having lots of viewers. 

It's increasingly important for businesses to have a content strategy - a plan for attracting and converting viewers with content.

Just as there are many different types of content, our products help with content in a variety of ways.

   ## Our History 
   
The company started operating on May 5, 2013 and was founded by 3 partners: Edmar Ferreira, Diego Gomes, and Vitor Peçanha in Belo Horizonte- BRA, in the so-called San Pedro Valley. It was born with the aim of changing the reality of companies' digital strategies by producing content and devising strategies to generate more online visibility for their customers.

What started as a back-of-the-napkin business idea in 2013 would become the largest content marketing solution and service provider in Latin America. With the acquisition of ScribbleLive, Rock Content is now a global enterprise with over 500 employees, six offices, and 2,000 customers. Together, we all share in Rock’s mission to create growth opportunities for our customers, talent community, and Rockers worldwide.   

   ## Our Values
   
1. Learn: we proactively learn technical and personal skills

I feel obliged to say that we are privileged to read a text like this. After all, to do this, it is likely that you used a modern notebook or a high-end smartphone connected to the internet.

The fact is that we are exposed to infinite learning possibilities. We are at a level to absorb knowledge and deliver great results. Just want and run.

At Rock, you learn new things every day. It doesn't matter if you are Harvard's “pika of the galaxies” or if you are the girl who serves coffee and doesn't have 4th grade. The heart is and always will be that of a student.

This learning value is practiced: Reading blogs and books; Understanding the best market practices; Talking to customers and other partners; Working on self-knowledge and experiences; Finding the right mentors.

2. Teach: we teach knowledge and behavior relevant to our development

I understand that it is necessary to have two weights and two measures, that is, at the same time that you learn, you teach. It is completely backward, for example, to acquire skills and keep them for yourself. The world is fluid and we live in an era of shared economy. Or do you think Uber and Airbnb are successful by chance?

At Rock, education is a key part. Educating clients and other stakeholders, such as freelancers, even before they establish a partnership. The company has a student spirit, but also a teacher.

Teaching happens: Producing educational content; Making people's daily lives better; Teaching customers and customers' customers through content; Understanding that, as you gain powers, you have great responsibilities.

3. Solve: we solve, proposing practical solutions or applying improvements responsibly

They say that knowledge is power. I don't exactly agree with that statement. I believe that knowledge is potential power. After all, without proactivity and hands-on knowledge does not make much difference.

At Rock, people who take the initiative are always valued and recognized. The company, despite having great know-how, maintains a beginner mindset. The start and construction of the company in the race, with many spreadsheets and Google, is never forgotten.

The resolution value is executed: Practicing the change you always seek; Proposing, before complaining; Never saying "this is not my problem"; Doing more with less.

4. Collaborate: we collaborate with each other through feedback (positive and / or constructive)

As we help others, we are helping ourselves. I love public praise and criticism, as long as they are constructive, in particular. To attend is to understand and when we create empathy everything changes, for the better.

At Rock, everyone needs to take care of the space so that the house is organized. Values ​​such as transparency and security are valued and practiced. Errors are assumed, but there is no problem with that. There is always someone to help.

Collaboration is developed: Choosing notable people, who want to do great things; Valuing achievements and telling them to the world; Being a team and doing what should be done; Giving honest feedback.

5. Grow: we grow together in a healthy, scalable, collaborative and sustainable way

Who likes to walk backwards is crab. I understand that people were born to move on, overcome challenges and shine. Conflicts are inevitable and often hard, but we always come out of adversity stronger and with several lessons.

At Rock, growth is something that is in the company's DNA. She has helped more than 1000 clients, has a base of thousands of freelancers and receives an amazing number of visits on her blogs, like this one from the Community.

Growth at Rock is chosen: Always wanting more; Making decisions based on data; Getting to know each other and comparing yourself with yourself.

6. Trust: we trust Rock, colleagues, partners and others involved in our purpose

I assume that the first bet should be on trust. We always feel good about this type of attitude and we also pass security to the person we trust. After all, trust is believing in the other's potential.

At Rock, trust is present in all actions. Each victory is valued and celebrated, from small to large. In addition, the company is fully aware that it will never build things on its own, so it trusts its thousands of partners.

Trust is lived: Understanding strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats; Delegating tasks and decentralizing powers; Committing to your success and that of all partners.

7. Care: we care about our customers, colleagues, and spaces

Have a saying I remember saying to ourselves we can go faster, but together we much further. Although we have our particularities, the world is plural and we must, yes, be concerned with others.

In Rock, caring for customers and other partners is also something that is in their DNA. This is in line with its mission to deliver quality content and that help build great results.

The value of caring happens: Continuously improving communication; Understanding to serve with excellence; Sharing content and knowledge.

8. Respect: we respect the other in all situations - personal and professional

The word respect speaks for itself. I do not quite understand this world of haters on social networks, which deliver free hatred. always remember a phrase of Chico Xavier says no one hurts the other without first hurt himself. Respect must be practiced from the inside out. First for yourself and then for people and the world.

At Rock, respect is closely linked to the company's philosophy. It is an essential “metric” for carrying out activities, achieving goals, and hitting goals.

Respect is carried out: Understanding that the world is diverse; Not admitting any kind of prejudice; Setting an example to inspire the people you relate to. So, you inspired? Adopting each of these values ​​in the Rock Culture Code is, first of all, giving a vote of confidence in yourself. With them, surely you will be a professional and a human being much better. Living a life that is worth living. That inspires and leaves traces of homesickness wherever it goes. And finally, never forget that those who give flowers always leave a little perfume in their hands.
