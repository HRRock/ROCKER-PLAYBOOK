## OUR PURPOSE

Welcome to our Rocker center!

You probably know this, but I'm saying it again: Rock changes a lot. Fast! All the time! That's what growing things do.
They change. So, we feel that the content we create about ourselves should do the same.

That's why we built Rocker Center

Here almost every page is fully editable. And you, fellow Rocker, are already an accredited editor. Feel free to add information, correct mistakes, and make our knowledge base grow and evolve with us. Don't worry too much. Every page is fully editable, and all changes can be reviewed, questioned, undone, and re-done whenever needed. Just do your best!

Here are a few suggestions on pages I think you'd like to start on. If that's not your thing, that's cool! Just hit the search bar and take a look around. Didn't find what you needed? Why not start your own page? Just click here to get started.

   ## Who we are
   
Basic Overview:
Rock Content is a Saas (software as a service) organization.
Our clients are other business (B2B) 
We have multiple products (Ion Interactive, Visually, Live, Studio, iClips and Rock.OS), all aimed at helping our clients to create content experiences that attract, engage, and convert their audiences.

What is content, and why is it important?
Content is important because it gets our attention. We all interact with content regularly: we find interesting articles on Facebook or Twitter, we receive email newsletters, we watch how-to videos on YouTube, we read news articles, we attend online webinars. All of these are examples of content...produced ultimately for one purpose: to get your attention.

Why is your attention so important? Because your attention may eventually convert to $. And dollars keep businesses alive.

How does attention lead to $?  The more targeted visitors an organization can attract, the greater the likelihood that many of those visitors will become paying customers. For brands, this means that a product or service may be purchased. For media organizations, subscriptions may be purchased to supplement the ad revenue they get from having lots of viewers. 

It's increasingly important for businesses to have a content strategy - a plan for attracting and converting viewers with content.

Just as there are many different types of content, our products help with content in a variety of ways.
