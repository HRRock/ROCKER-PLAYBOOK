## [1.OUR PURPOSE][our-purpose] 

 * [1.1 Who we are][who-we-are]

Welcome to our Rocker center!
You probably know this, but I'm saying it again: Rock changes a lot. Fast! All the time! That's what growing things do.They change. So, we feel that the content we create about ourselves should do the same.
That's why we built Rocker Center
Here almost every page is fully editable. And you, fellow Rocker, are already an accredited editor. Feel free to add information, correct mistakes, and make our knowledge base grow and evolve with us. Don't worry too much. Every page is fully editable, and all changes can be reviewed, questioned, undone, and re-done whenever needed. Just do your best!
Here are a few suggestions on pages I think you'd like to start on. If that's not your thing, that's cool! Just hit the search bar and take a look around. Didn't find what you needed? Why not start your own page? Just click here to get started.
