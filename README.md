Also referred to as #dataRocks, this team's mission is to make the endless sea of information that makes up the database of Rock Content's Products and Systems, available for Rockers to use in their daily work.

The team was oficially born on April 2019. Up until that point, each team at Rock had their own operation analysts responsible for both gathering, processing and analyzing the necessary data for the team's controls.

Billable info

DataRocks routines are based on Agile practices.

**Routines:**
Daily Meeting
Frequency: Every weekday. Mondays are 11 AM. Tue-Fri are 9AM, on a fixed Google Calendar event;
Duration: ~ 20 minutes.

Objective: Daily updates on ongoing challenges and tasks. Safe space to share news and upcoming changes with the team as soon as possible.

Daily Bot [Deprecated, kept for registry]
Format: Daily, through the form everyone will fill in:

What I did today;
What am I going to do tomorrow;
If there are any obstacles preventing me from performing a task;
At 8 am the next day, we will be updated with everyone's responses via the ‘Daily Scrum’ bot on the #dataRocks channel in the chat. From there, we will have threads of interactions with the responses.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays we will have the on-site Dailys, for a better alignment of the team regarding the interactions with the responses to the bot threads.

How to make the most out of the Remote Daily:

Set aside 10 quiet minutes, every day, at the end of your workday.

Open this form (Daily Scrum #dataRocks) and write down:

What have I done today?
What will I do tomorrow?
Is something holding me back?
On the next business day, at 8AM, the bot will publish all the entries in the dataRocks chatroom.

What to write?

Your writing form in entirely up to you. You can experiment with broad strokes or granular updates. It all comes down to how do you feel about the work you're writing about.

That's why I'm recommending some 10 minutes to think, instead of 2 minutes to write.

Me and you and everyone else will make mistakes and have bad days.

That's OK!

**Roadmaps**
All the project's Roadmaps are in the drive.

What is a roadmap?

A high level plan, defining a comprehensive strategic objective and capturing the main steps planned to achieve that objective.

A list of resources alone will not capture or articulate the strategic thinking behind building a product in a specific way. Creating a valid product roadmap requires telling a cohesive story - showing how all individual initiatives, features and tasks will come together and result in a product that meets specific company goals.

A communication tool that helps to communicate the product strategy.

What does a resource list communicate? In addition to the items on the list, not much. That's why a solid product roadmap requires clear and concise strategic logic to include any resource or epic. If a product manager cannot convincingly establish the inclusion of a feature, he should not include it.

**Format:**
Roadmaps are organized into subtitles, each with its function described below.

**Vision:**
The purpose of the Vision is to generate alignment on the motivation of any part of the project that is being worked on. It should provide enough context for those involved to know the reason and impact of that Roadmap. Thus, it is composed of the current situation and the problems that are experienced in it, and also of the ideal world where these problems are solved and how people's lives are better because of this. It is a story telling tool, which connects technical work at the tip of #dataRocks with the needs and objectives of Rock Content.

**Strategy**
In strategy, we explore the path between the world as it is, and how it could be. What are - in a broad way - the resources we have at hand to close the bridge? More practical descriptions, without technical deepening, of the technologies, tools and processes that will be used to carry out the project.

**Goal**
Goals are milestones of progress that help us understand that we are on the right track. They must be incremental, built on the achievement of the other. They need a date and a clear metric that determines the success of the execution.

**Initiatives**
Each initiative is one of the parts that make up a Project. They can be palpable structures, such as dashboards, or technical resources such as tables, ETLs and scripts. Initiatives can be carried out in parallel, if there is no technical dependence on each other. In a Gantt chart, each initiative is a streak of the project.

**Features**
Each feature is a user's need. It is something that he needs to do to reach a specific result. A feature tells you what will be done, how it will be done and the expected result of taking this action.

User stories are always written in the first person and the narrator defines who the final audience for that resource is. Model we use:

I, as such a function, need such a resource to accomplish that goal.

**Metrics**
Ideally, the success of the work is anchored in facts that can be measured without the need for subjective interpretation. In cases where it is not possible, due to problems with instrumentation or the nature of the work, it is acceptable to use discrete conditions such as commits, publications and accepted by email. Subjective conditions should be avoided as much as possible.

**Business Requirement and Definitions**
Where there are business definitions, constraints, relevant legislation and other technical requirements, these must be clearly broken down. An application can be renegotiated if necessary, but never ignored.

**User Stories breakdown**
The breaking of stories tells, in plain text, how the user's goal is expected to be accomplished. Different objectives will need the appropriate level of detail so that the whole process is clearly understood. The detail includes technical details, queries, pieces of code and documentation. The objective is to align the way of working with the team and there is no need for interference or understanding by the end user of the process.

**Task Information** 
According to the complexity described in the details of the History, a specific multiple of tasks will be generated for its execution.

Each task should be the smallest possible block to track and detail in Asana, but it can contain sub-tasks for internal milestones, check-ups and follow-ups.

Although the sub-tasks may be other owners, it is the task assignee who is responsible for making sure its completion

**Workflow Taiga**
Since April 2020, we have killed of Asana in favour of Taiga. A project management software hosted on taiga.rockcontent.com

**Team Communication**
Chat room to inform and discuss the Metabase, activities and routines of the Dailys project and bot with the members: #dataRocks

Chat room to inform and discuss the implementation and use of Metabase in content: [CONTENT] #dataRocks

## 1.THE COMPANY

Welcome to our Rocker center!

You probably know this, but I'm saying it again: Rock changes a lot. Fast! All the time! That's what growing things do.
They change. So, we feel that the content we create about ourselves should do the same.

That's why we built Rocker Center

Here almost every page is fully editable. And you, fellow Rocker, are already an accredited editor. Feel free to add information, correct mistakes, and make our knowledge base grow and evolve with us. Don't worry too much. Every page is fully editable, and all changes can be reviewed, questioned, undone, and re-done whenever needed. Just do your best!

Here are a few suggestions on pages I think you'd like to start on. If that's not your thing, that's cool! Just hit the search bar and take a look around. Didn't find what you needed? Why not start your own page? Just click here to get started.

   ## 1.1 Who we are
   
Rock Content is a content marketing company. We are helping other companies to create and introduce a perfect content marketing strategy. Rock Content has been active in the Brazilian market for 6 years. Today the company has more than 1600 customers and 450 employees and is considered the largest content marketing company in Latin America.   
   
Basic Overview:

We have multiple products (Ion Interactive, Visually, Live, Studio, iClips and Rock.OS), all aimed at helping our clients to create content experiences that attract, engage, and convert their audiences.

What is content, and why is it important?
Content is important because it gets our attention. We all interact with content regularly: we find interesting articles on Facebook or Twitter, we receive email newsletters, we watch how-to videos on YouTube, we read news articles, we attend online webinars. All of these are examples of content...produced ultimately for one purpose: to get your attention.

Why is your attention so important? Because your attention may eventually convert to $. And dollars keep businesses alive.

How does attention lead to $?  The more targeted visitors an organization can attract, the greater the likelihood that many of those visitors will become paying customers. For brands, this means that a product or service may be purchased. For media organizations, subscriptions may be purchased to supplement the ad revenue they get from having lots of viewers. 

It's increasingly important for businesses to have a content strategy - a plan for attracting and converting viewers with content.

Just as there are many different types of content, our products help with content in a variety of ways.

   ## 1.2 Our History 
   
The company started operating on May 5, 2013 and was founded by 3 partners: Edmar Ferreira, Diego Gomes, and Vitor Peçanha in Belo Horizonte- BRA, in the so-called San Pedro Valley. It was born with the aim of changing the reality of companies' digital strategies by producing content and devising strategies to generate more online visibility for their customers.

What started as a back-of-the-napkin business idea in 2013 would become the largest content marketing solution and service provider in Latin America. With the acquisition of ScribbleLive, Rock Content is now a global enterprise with over 500 employees, six offices, and 2,000 customers. Together, we all share in Rock’s mission to create growth opportunities for our customers, talent community, and Rockers worldwide.   

   ## 1.3 Our Values
   
1. Learn: we proactively learn technical and personal skills

I feel obliged to say that we are privileged to read a text like this. After all, to do this, it is likely that you used a modern notebook or a high-end smartphone connected to the internet.

The fact is that we are exposed to infinite learning possibilities. We are at a level to absorb knowledge and deliver great results. Just want and run.

At Rock, you learn new things every day. It doesn't matter if you are Harvard's “pika of the galaxies” or if you are the girl who serves coffee and doesn't have 4th grade. The heart is and always will be that of a student.

This learning value is practiced: Reading blogs and books; Understanding the best market practices; Talking to customers and other partners; Working on self-knowledge and experiences; Finding the right mentors.

2. Teach: we teach knowledge and behavior relevant to our development

I understand that it is necessary to have two weights and two measures, that is, at the same time that you learn, you teach. It is completely backward, for example, to acquire skills and keep them for yourself. The world is fluid and we live in an era of shared economy. Or do you think Uber and Airbnb are successful by chance?

At Rock, education is a key part. Educating clients and other stakeholders, such as freelancers, even before they establish a partnership. The company has a student spirit, but also a teacher.

Teaching happens: Producing educational content; Making people's daily lives better; Teaching customers and customers' customers through content; Understanding that, as you gain powers, you have great responsibilities.

3. Solve: we solve, proposing practical solutions or applying improvements responsibly

They say that knowledge is power. I don't exactly agree with that statement. I believe that knowledge is potential power. After all, without proactivity and hands-on knowledge does not make much difference.

At Rock, people who take the initiative are always valued and recognized. The company, despite having great know-how, maintains a beginner mindset. The start and construction of the company in the race, with many spreadsheets and Google, is never forgotten.

The resolution value is executed: Practicing the change you always seek; Proposing, before complaining; Never saying "this is not my problem"; Doing more with less.

4. Collaborate: we collaborate with each other through feedback (positive and / or constructive)

As we help others, we are helping ourselves. I love public praise and criticism, as long as they are constructive, in particular. To attend is to understand and when we create empathy everything changes, for the better.

At Rock, everyone needs to take care of the space so that the house is organized. Values ​​such as transparency and security are valued and practiced. Errors are assumed, but there is no problem with that. There is always someone to help.

Collaboration is developed: Choosing notable people, who want to do great things; Valuing achievements and telling them to the world; Being a team and doing what should be done; Giving honest feedback.

5. Grow: we grow together in a healthy, scalable, collaborative and sustainable way

Who likes to walk backwards is crab. I understand that people were born to move on, overcome challenges and shine. Conflicts are inevitable and often hard, but we always come out of adversity stronger and with several lessons.

At Rock, growth is something that is in the company's DNA. She has helped more than 1000 clients, has a base of thousands of freelancers and receives an amazing number of visits on her blogs, like this one from the Community.

Growth at Rock is chosen: Always wanting more; Making decisions based on data; Getting to know each other and comparing yourself with yourself.

6. Trust: we trust Rock, colleagues, partners and others involved in our purpose

I assume that the first bet should be on trust. We always feel good about this type of attitude and we also pass security to the person we trust. After all, trust is believing in the other's potential.

At Rock, trust is present in all actions. Each victory is valued and celebrated, from small to large. In addition, the company is fully aware that it will never build things on its own, so it trusts its thousands of partners.

Trust is lived: Understanding strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats; Delegating tasks and decentralizing powers; Committing to your success and that of all partners.

7. Care: we care about our customers, colleagues, and spaces

Have a saying I remember saying to ourselves we can go faster, but together we much further. Although we have our particularities, the world is plural and we must, yes, be concerned with others.

In Rock, caring for customers and other partners is also something that is in their DNA. This is in line with its mission to deliver quality content and that help build great results.

The value of caring happens: Continuously improving communication; Understanding to serve with excellence; Sharing content and knowledge.

8. Respect: we respect the other in all situations - personal and professional

The word respect speaks for itself. I do not quite understand this world of haters on social networks, which deliver free hatred. always remember a phrase of Chico Xavier says no one hurts the other without first hurt himself. Respect must be practiced from the inside out. First for yourself and then for people and the world.

At Rock, respect is closely linked to the company's philosophy. It is an essential “metric” for carrying out activities, achieving goals, and hitting goals.

Respect is carried out: Understanding that the world is diverse; Not admitting any kind of prejudice; Setting an example to inspire the people you relate to. So, you inspired? Adopting each of these values ​​in the Rock Culture Code is, first of all, giving a vote of confidence in yourself. With them, surely you will be a professional and a human being much better. Living a life that is worth living. That inspires and leaves traces of homesickness wherever it goes. And finally, never forget that those who give flowers always leave a little perfume in their hands.

I hope you enjoyed this text, which was written with the heart and a few hints of reason. I want your opinion, will you? If so, leave a comment below

Visually's mission is to help businesses create visual content that rises above the noise.
Our platform connects designers, journalists, animators and developers with clients. Visually features cloud-based collaboration tools that allow us to deliver high-quality content at unprecedented scale and speed.

Example:
LinkedIn wanted to create a video to communicate the results of a survey and promote their 'Talent Solutions' products. This was a top of the funnel piece of content that drove Recruiters to a page where they could register to download a report. 

https://get.visual.ly/m/design-portfolio/job-seeker-trend-report-linkedin/ 

Visually matched LinkedIn to the correct talent. The Visually platform is where all of the collaboration happened. The video is the result.

OrgDev is a super nice team!
They support Rock Content through the use of data and analysis.
A small part of the work is maintaining our databases clean, usable and true to the facts. Whenever something gets changed in the database, we document it in some easy to follow documents.
The table plan_histories, in RC1, is documented in HammerTime.
Since Fabiano is currently messing around with the teams and moderator_teams, we do have a separate document for them as well: CS teams at RC1.

Right now, OrgDev is trying to keep sharp focus on 2020. There is a list of priorities for the team in 2020 already out.
